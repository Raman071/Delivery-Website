## 🤔 Reflection and Future Ideas

### Reflection
- The original use cases from planning remained linked to the final product implementation actively.
- The development process became more efficient because of the planning activities at Phase 1.
- The key implementation challenge was installing real-time order tracking because developing this was designated as an important future update requirement.
- Gained significant experience working with full-stack development and JWT-based authentication.
